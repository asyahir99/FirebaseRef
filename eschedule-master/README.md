e-Schedule

Project Description
E-schedule is a system that is more routinely used to plan and handle an event that saves time and effort. 
The system is intended to be used to handle their daily schedules by school of computingâ€™s lectures and students of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. 
For example, students will see which class has begun and where they are located. 
Therefore, as for lecturer will be able to manage and organize their class period and location. 
Since people use their smartphone more often than laptop, 
the existing of this system can be strengthened by optimization of new and advanced smartphone technology.

Project Motivation and Goal
The current system, designed around 2002, 
is available on mobile devices or personal computers using the browser. 
The framework seems to be scarcely updated since the user interfaces seem out of date and boring.
The main page interface design of HTML-based user experience is confusing, 
and since the existing system is available only in the browser, 
it is also difficult for mobile device users to look at the same way as the desktop, 
as the display cannot be dynamic to adjust screen size. 
Thus, we will enhance the experience of users using smartphones with the development of a new web mobile application.
